In this SQL code, I'm querying a database that holds Nexflix data to answer questions about the data.

1. How many movie titles are in the database? (excluding tv shows)
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" 
WHERE type = 'Movie';

2. What is the most recent date that any tv shows and/or movies were added to the database?
SELECT MAX(date(date_added))
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info";

3. List all the movies and tv shows in alphabetical order.
SELECT title
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
ORDER BY title asc;

4. Who is the director of the movie "Bright Star"?
SELECT people.director, titles.title
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_people" people
LEFT JOIN "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" titles
ON people.show_id = titles.show_id
WHERE titles.title = 'Bright Star';

What is the oldest movie in the database and when was it released?
SELECT title, release_year
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
WHERE type = 'Movie'
ORDER BY release_year asc
LIMIT 1;
